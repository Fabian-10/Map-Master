# Map-Master

This game was developed by 11 students at Whitworth University. I happened to be the leader of this project, alongside Dominic G. Gusman (dgusman24@my.whitworth.edu).

The rest of the participants are:


* Ellie McLemore (emclemore28@my.whitworth.edu)
* Kekoa Hamasaki (khamasaki24@my.whitworth.edu)
* Demilade Tope-Babalola (dtope-babalola28@my.whitworth.edu)
* Kylie Andreyevna Loveless (kloveless27@my.whitworth.edu)
* Kenai Charles Herrick (kherrick26@my.whitworth.edu)
* Bilal Hasan (bhasan26@my.whitworth.edu)

* Enerelt Enkhtur (eenkhtur26@my.whitworth.edu)
* Uchka Chuluunbaatar (uchuluunbaatar26@my.whitworth.edu).

The commit titled "Demo" represents the beta version that we, as a group, accomplished.
